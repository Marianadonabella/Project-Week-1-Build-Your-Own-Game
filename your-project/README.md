## Project Description
The project consists in creating a code that generates a strong password.
It is useful in our day to day life, for safety reasons.

## Rules
The user will chose how many caracters he/she wants in the password, and then what other rules the password should follow:
- Should it have upper and lower cases? 
- Should it have special caracters (! % & .) ?
- Should it include numbers and letters?

## Workflow
The workflow consisted in :
- Building a trello board
- Researching the game
- Forking the repository
- Editing the readme (information)
- Coding
- Testing
- Creating presentation
