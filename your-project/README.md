## Project Description
The project consists in creating a code that generates a strong password.
It is useful in our day to day life, for safety reasons.

## Rules
The user will chose how many caracters he/she wants in the password, and then what other rules the password should follow:
- Should it have upper and lower cases? 
- Should it have special caracters (! % & .) ?
- Should it include numbers and letters?

## Workflow
The workflow consisted in :
- Building a trello board
- Researching the game
- Forking the repository
- Editing the readme (information)
- Coding
- Testing
- Creating presentation

## Organization
The organization of the project was make with Trello. 
The organization of the code and ideas were made in regular handwritten notes, and then, nce settled, passed to jupyter notebook.

My repository contains:
- The readme file
- The notebook file where I wrote the code step by step, following the structure I first set, and testing every part of it
- The library I did with the functions containing my code
- The notebook to actually play de game
