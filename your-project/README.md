## Project Description
The project consists in creating a code that generates a strong password.
It is useful in our day to day life, for safety reasons.

## Rules
The user will chose how many characters he/she wants in the password, and the computer will generate a random and strong password: it will contain upper and lower letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Workflow
The workflow consisted in :
- Building a trello board
- Researching the game
- Forking the repository
- Writing game structure
- Coding
- Testing
- Creating presentation
- Updating readme file
- Last check

## Organization
The organization of the project was made with Trello. 
The organization of the code and ideas were made in regular handwritten notes, and then, once settled, passed to jupyter notebook.
All of the material used was put in one specific folder

My repository contains:
- The readme file
- The notebook file where I wrote the code step by step, following the structure I first set, and testing every part of it
- The library I did with the functions containing my code
- The notebook to actually play de game
